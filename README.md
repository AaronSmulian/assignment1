In this report I will be explaining how my Android Studio applcation works. This is the first app that I have created, which I have named, Assignment 1. The creation of this app was very difficult but enjoyable at the same time, it took ne roughly 20 hours to code and design. It is very new to a person who has never coded before. Let me go through the code and desgin with you.

- this is an image of my first 'textView' value. It is my 'headingTextView', which says 'History', it has been assigned to 'headingTextView'. The text has been set to black, it has an italic font with a 'textsize' of '100sp'. It has been placed at the top of the screen due to it being a heading or title, i chose a bigger font to attract the user to want to use the app or have a enjoyable time using it. It took a bit of time because it was new to me. While doing this project, it was still me learning my way around Android Studio, but it was definitely enjoyable creating this part.

- this is an image of my 'editText' value, which has been assigned to 'tableNumberEditText'. This is the text which inputs the user's age(integer), this value will be used later. I coded the 'editView' to match it with a historical figure (who died at the same age as the user is). This text has been coded to have an underline, to emphasize the prompt and/or attract the user to want to imput an age. The text has been set to black with a black underline. As well as the 'textSize' has been set to '40sp' with an 'ems of 10'.
