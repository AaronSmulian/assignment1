In this report I will be explaining how my Android Studio applcation works. This is the first app that I have created, which I have named, Assignment1. The creation of this app was very difficult but enjoyable at the same time, it took ne roughly 20 hours to code and design. It is very new to a person who has never coded before. Let me go through the code and desgin with you.
